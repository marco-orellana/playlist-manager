# playlist-manager
Web Application that allows the user to have multiple playlists fetched from the database, search the musics from the Discogs APi and add them to the desired playlist. The client was written in Javascript/React. The server made with Node.js offers a REST API that communicate with JSON made with Express.js and allows persistence in a PostgreSQL database. We had 1 week to make the project.

I worked on the server side of the project (Server.js, Dao.js, Playlist.js).
